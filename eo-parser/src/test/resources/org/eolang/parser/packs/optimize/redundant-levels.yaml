# Currently the test converts the code from the snippet to:
# ____
#
# [] > another
#   eq. > @
#     another$t0$first > first
#       second
#     another$t0$second > second
#       first
#
# [second] > another$t0$first
#   1 > @
#
# [first] > another$t0$second
#   2 > @
# ____
# Which actually looks strange.

# @todo #2131:90min Remove redundant objects and levels.
#  It's better to remove redundant objects from the result code snippet.
#  When the transformation is fixed we can enable the test.
#  The test should convert the code from the snippet to the next:
# ____
# [] > another
#   eq. > @
#     another$t0$first > first
#     another$t0$second > second
#
# [] > another$t0$first
#   1 > @
#
# [] > another$t0$second
#   2 > @
