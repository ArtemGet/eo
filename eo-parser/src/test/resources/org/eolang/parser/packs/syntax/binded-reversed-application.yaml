# @todo #2729:60min Enable the test when it's possible. Current syntax is not supported now. In our
#  EBNF such is understood as vertical application with 3 arguments. But all arguments in
#  application must be either all bound or not. But it should not be like that with reversed
#  application. Need to extend the grammar and make sure the test works. Don't forget to remove the
#  puzzle.
