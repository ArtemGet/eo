# @todo #2526:30min Enable the test when it's possible. Such syntax is invalid - scope braces should
#  not be placed on different lines. It happens because of the next sequence of rules:
#  scopeExtended -> happlicationExtended -> happlicationHeadExtended -> vmethod. The sequence
#  allows using of vertical method in the head of scoped horizontal application. It should not be
#  legal. Don't forget to remove the puzzle.
