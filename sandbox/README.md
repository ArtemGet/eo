You can play with EOLANG here, in a few simple steps:

First, clone this repo to your local machine and go
to the `sandbox` directory:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/yegor256/eo.git
$ cd sandbox
```

Then, compile the code (you will need
[Maven 3.3+](https://maven.apache.org/)
and Java 8+ installed):

```bash
$ mvn compile
```

Then, just run it:

```bash
$ ./run.sh 9
9th Fibonacci number is 34
```

Should work. If it doesn't, [submit an issue](https://github.com/yegor256/eo/issues),
we will fix it.
